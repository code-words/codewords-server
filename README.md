# Codewords Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/code-words/codewords-server.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/code-words/codewords-server)

This is the server side of the Codewords game. It manages game state and handles turn logic, however it does not have a built-in front-end. You will also need the Codewords UI available within this organization.

### API Endpoints

- [Create/Initiate Game](#create_game)
